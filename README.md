# Purely Functional Data Structures
This repository contains selected examples and solutions to exercises
from [*Purely Functional Data Structures*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/594288.Purely_Functional_Data_Structures).

Note that this is a personal learning place that was created while
reading the book. I do encourage others to buy and read it!

Haskell code can be found in an [IHaskell](https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell)
notebook `pfds.ipynb`. In order to view and edit it one can start a
Docker container running Jupyter with IHaskell kernel via
```bash
make ihaskell
```
or just `make`.
