    "### Qutput-Restricted Deques\n",
    "An intermediate step between FIFO queues and *double-ended queue (or deques)* are *output-restricted queues* which, additionaly to ordinary queues, provide a `cons :: a -> q a -> q a` function. Class `OutputRestrictedDeque` thus supports insertion to both ends but inspection and removal only from the front.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some `Queue` instances can easily be extended with custom `cons` implementations. For instance for the Banker's queue we have\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "cons :: a -> BankersQueue a -> BankersQueue a\n",
    "cons x (BQ lenf f lenr r) = BQ (lenf + 1) (x:f) lenr r\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the real-time queue prepends new element `x` to `f` but also to `s` to maintain the invariant $|s| = |f| - |r|$:\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "cons :: a -> RealTimeQueue a -> RealTimeQueue a\n",
    "cons x (RTQ f r s) = RTQ (x:f) r (x:s)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, for some queues (e.g. the `HoodMelvilleQueue`) such trivial implementation is not possible. Fortunately, it's possible to implement generic wrapper (see `ConstQueue` below) which maintains explicit front list and provides `cons` in $O(1)$ worst case time and other operations with constant overhead over respective operations of an underlying queue."

    "While standard queues can be berfetly balanced (all elemnts end up in the front part), this is not possible for deques that can be updated from both ends which define perfect balance as having equal distribution of elements between the front and the rear part.\n",

    "## Real-Time Deque\n",
    "`RealTimeDeque` is an extension of `RealTimeQueue` which schedules both front and rear list. And as an instance of *lazy rebuilding* and *scheduling* combination, there are two steps to make the data structure:\n",
    " 1. identify and break monolithic operations into incremental ones\n",
    " 1. schedule the execution of suspensions from these new operations so that relevant portion is a priori memoized\n",

    "\n",
