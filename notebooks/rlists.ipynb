    "## Binary Random Access List\n",
    "\n",
    "### Representation\n",
    "`BinaryList` presented below is based on a (dense) binary numerical representation - that is, a `BinaryList` of with $n$ elements constins a *complete binary leaf tree* for each one in the dense binary representation of $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The random access list is represented as a list of `Digit`s which can ither be `Zero` or `One (Tree a)` where the tree is a complete binary leaf tree (i.e. a binary tree in with data stored just in leafs).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to storing list elements in the `Leaf`s, the implementation below also includes the tree size in each `Node`. Note that the size is redundant since it can be deduced either from the parent size or by the position in the list of digits (which is kept in increasing order of the size - i.e. rank).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we store the elements in a left-to-right order both within and between trees. Under this repreentation both the number of trees and the tree depth is logarithmic in $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operations\n",
    "The `cons` and `tail` operations (resp. `consTree` and `unconsTree`) are analogous to `inc` and `dec` respective implementation of `DenseNat`. Since they do at most $O(1)$ work per `Digit` and there's at most `O(log(n))` threes in the list, their worst case time is `O(log(n))`. And since `head` is basically the same as `tail` but instead of discarding the head it resurns it, it also runs in `O(log(n))` time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other two operations, that is `lookup` and `update` both take the advantage of the list represenation described above. They both perform two successive logarithmic steps and thus run in `O(log(n))` worst case time:\n",
    " 1. find the appropriate tree in the list by comparing its size and the index\n",
    " 1. in this tree find and return (update) by again checking against the size field whether to search the left or right sub-tree\n",
    "\n",
    "The only difference between these two is that `update` also copies the path from the root to the updated leaf."

    "### Representation\n",
    "A `RedundantBinaryList` is an adaptation of the `ZerolessBinaryList` which adds a *redundant numerical representation* on top of the *(dense) zeroless binary numerical representation* in which each `Digit` is either\n",
    " - `One` containing single complete binary tree (the \"dangerous\" state for `consTree`)\n",
    " - or `Two` holding two complete binary trees (the \"safe\" state)\n",
    " - or `Three` holding three complete binary trees (the \"dangerous\" state for `unconsTree`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operations\n",
    "The redundancy is motivated by the `LazyNat` instance and makes the `consTree` (analogous to `inc`) and `unconsTree` (analogous to `dec`) to run in $O(1)$ amortized time. Due to this fact, `cons` and `tail` also run in this improved amortized complexity and `head` is still worst case $O(1)$ due to the zeroless representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `One` and `Three` digits are the \"dangerous\" states for respective operations while `Two` is the \"safe\" one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extensions\n",
    "Finally, as it's common to other lazy amortized structures, *scheduling* can improve the amortized bounds on `cons` and `tail` to worst case bounds - meaning to $O(1)$ worst case time. Introduction and management of a schedule can be achieved in a way similar to the represenation and operations of the `ScheduledBinomialHeap`."
