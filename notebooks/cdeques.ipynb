    "## Simple Catenable Deque\n",
    "`SimpleCatDeque` is a *structural abstraction* of standard `Deque`s that implements the *implicit recursive slowdown* to provide a concatenation operator that runs in $O(log(n))$ amortized time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the implementation and discussion below we assume that there is an existing `Deque` instance that with $O(1)$ operations (either worst-case or amortized). For example both `BankersDeque` and `RealTimeDeque` satisfy this assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Representation\n",
    "`SimpleCatDeque d` structurally abstracts a *primitive* `Deque d` and as such forms a non-uniformly recursive structure. Moreover, since it follows the *implicit recursive slowdown*, this deque has two type constructors:\n",
    " 1. `Shallow` simply holds a primitive deque `d`\n",
    " 1. `Deep` has three parts: the front - a primitive deque, middle - `SimpleCatDeque` with `d` as elements and rear - also a primitive deque\n",
    " \n",
    "There is an addition invariant imposed on the `Deep` deque which states that both the front and rear primitive deques must contain at least 2 element (otherwise the deque must be downgraded to a `Shallow` one).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operations\n",
    "Starting with the set of simple operations: `cons`, `snoc`, `head` and `last` all simply propagate to the respective operation on the underlying primitive `Deque`. That is either from the `Shallow` type or in case of a `Deep` deque according to the operation to the front or rear part.\n",
    "\n",
    "`head` and `last` take $O(1)$ steps in the worst-case and depending on the instance of the primitive deque, `cons` with `snoc` run in $O(1)$ worst-case or amortized time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next two operations, `tail` and `init`, are symmetric in implementation and just operate in $O(1)$ amortized time on either the front or the rear part of either a deque. In case of a `Shallow`, the operation simply propagates to the primitive deque but for a `Deep` deque there are three cases to consider:\n",
    " - `tail f` (`init r`) has at lest than 2 elements => new `Deep` can safely be constructed with that part in place\n",
    " - there is not enough elements and the middle is empty => the deque downgrades into a `Shallow` one with the remaining elements transferred to the appropriate side of the rest (using either `dappendL` or `dappendR`)\n",
    " - the result is too small and the middle is non-empty => appropriate side (primitive deque) is taken from the middle and the remaining elements are transferred to it as in the previous case forming a new front or rear of new `Deep` deque\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the concatenation operator `++` can be proved to run in $O(log(n))$ amortized time and takes an advantage of the `Deque` operations described above. There are 4 cases depending on the operand types involved in `++` but two of them are symmetric:\n",
    " - both deques are `Shallow` => if either one is too small (has less than 2 elements) then it's appended to the appropriate side of the other and the result is `Shallow`, otherwise both operands fill the sides of a new `Deep` deque\n",
    " - one of the operands is `Shallow` and the other is `Deep` => if the shallow deque is too small then its element is moved to the appropriate side of the deep one, otherwise it replaces such side and the original front/rear is moved to the middle part\n",
    " - both deques are `Deep` => front of the former and rear of the latter deque form new front and rear and new middle is constructed by concatenating the rest of the first operand with the initial part of the second operand\n",
    "\n",
    "Last but not least, the complexity of `++` is indeed logarithmic but it can be stated more precisely with respect to the sizes $n_1$ and $n_2$ of the first and second operand respectively as $O(min(log(n_1), log(n_2)))$."

    "`ImplicitCatDeque` is a *structural abstraction* of standard `Deque`s that implements the *implicit recursive slowdown* to provide a concatenation operator that runs in $O(1)$ amortized time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is similar to the `SimpleCatDeque` but with more segments and more complicated *compound elements* held by the recursive parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Representation\n",
    "The `ImplicitCatDeque` is similar in structure to the `SimpleCatDeque` but is composed of five segments `(f, a, m, b, r)` instead of three:\n",
    " - the front part `f` is an ordinary `Deque` that must contain at least 3 elements\n",
    " - a catenable deque `a` of *compound elements*\n",
    " - the middle `m` is now an ordinary `Deque` that must contain at least 2 elements\n",
    " - a catenable deque `b` of *compound elements*\n",
    " - the rear part `r` is an ordinary `Deque` that must contain at least 3 elements\n",
    "\n",
    "A *compound element* can either be:\n",
    " - `Simple` - holding an ordinary `Deque` of at least two elements\n",
    " - `Cmpd` - a compound element `(f, c, r)` where `f` and `r` are ordinary `Deque`s (again of size at least 2) and `c` is a catenable deque of compound elements\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the definition of `ImplicitCatDeque` described above assumes language support for *polymorphic recursion*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operations\n",
    "All the \"basic\" operation like `cons`, `snoc`, `head` and `tail` are analogous in implementation to the ones of `SimpleCatDeque` and run in $O(1)$ worst-case or amortized time by the assumtion on the underlying `Deque`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, `tail` and `init` (which is again symmetrical to `tail`) now have more cases to consider. In general they remove the primitive front element and reconstruct the rest of the queue by moving parts around while maintining the invariant on indiviual segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance for the `tail` function it first depends whether 1) the front deque has more than 3 elements (i.e. enought to just remove the head) or 2) is of the size 3, just barely satisfying the invariant. In the latter case there are three further possibilities:\n",
    " 1. segment `a` is non-empty and can be borrowed from to reconstruct valit rear\n",
    " 1. segment `a` is empty but `b` is non-empty and again deques (elements) can be moved from it to the middle and rear\n",
    " 1. both compound element deques `a` and `b` are empty => remaining pards are downgraded to `Shallow` deques and concatenated to form a new one\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be shown (see the book) that both `tail` and `init` run in $O(1)$ amortized time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the idea behind improving the complexity of `++` operator is to make it not call itself recursively. This means that `++` can only call `cons` and `snoc` at the next level (which are by the deque assumption constant operations).\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to the concatenation of `SimpleCatDeque`, the implementation here has four cases for each combination of `Shallow` and `Deep` deques but in general it is just shuffeling segments and elements around and since all the basic operations are constant, `++` can be shown to run in $O(1)$ amortized time."
