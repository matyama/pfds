    "\n",
    "The difference is that this instance is a closer representant of the *global rebuilding* technique while the `RealTimeQueue` showcases the *lazy rebuilding* and *scheduling* combination to achieve the same properties. Particularly, the differences lie in the details of the incremental rotation and consequently the queue representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rotation\n",
    "Again the goal is to make reversal and then append plus reversal incremental.\n",
    "\n",
    "First an incremental reversal can be captured by two states: `Working xs ys` and `Done xs` where the former represents gradual transfer of the head of `xs` to `ys` and the letter the final state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Appending two lists `xs` and `ys` works similarly in two passes:\n",
    " 1. reverse `xs` to get `xs'` - state `Reversing xs xs' ys`\n",
    " 1. reverse `xs'` onto `ys` - state `Appending xs' ys`\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to append `f` onto `reverse r` we need three reversals in total, two  of which can be done in parallel:\n",
    " 1. reverse `f` and `r` in parallel to get `f'` and `r'` - state `Reversing f f' r r'`\n",
    " 1. reverse `f'` onto `r'` - state `Appending f' r'`\n",
    "\n",
    "There is, however, a problem with the state transitioning if done in a naive way. If we call `tail` during a rotation $k$ times then the first $k$ elements of the resulting list are invalid. To fix this we have few options:\n",
    " 1. Track the number of invalid elements and add new rotational state `Deleting` that removes requred number of invalid elements (this corresponds to the definition of *global rebuilding*)\n",
    " 1. Track the number `ok` of valid elements in `f'` and stop the rotation from `f'` ot `r'` when `ok == 0`. Every call to `tail` during a rotation then `invalidate`s elements (decrements `ok`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Representation\n",
    "First the `RotationState` consists of four states:\n",
    " - `Reversing`, `Appending` and `Done` correspond to the states described above\n",
    " - `Idle` is a dummy state that is used for situations \"inbetween\" rotations\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the queue itself is a five-tuple consisting of\n",
    " 1. field `lenf` is the length of the list that is under construction (not the working copy - the front field)\n",
    " 1. next field is a working copy of the front of the queue (an old copy of the front that is under construction to efficiently answer `head` queries)\n",
    " 1. then there's the `RotationState` described above\n",
    " 1. field `lenr` is the length of the rear\n",
    " 1. the last field is the rear of the queue\n",
    "\n",
    "During a rotation the head elements of the queue end up in the back of `f'` within the rotational state. By keeping a working copy of the old front in the queue we can efficiently answer `head` queries. This is sound as long as new copy is ready by the time the old is exhausted."

    "## Bootstrapped Queue\n",
    "*Bootstrapped queue* is a queue instance based on *structural decomposition* of the `BankersQueue`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A series of rotations on `BankersQueue` results in structure that looks like `((f ++ reverse r1) ++ reverse r2) ++ ... ++ reverse rk`. It is obvious that `BankersQueue` processes the front $k$ times and each $r_i$ is accessed $k - i - 1$ times. The total cost is linear just because each $r_{i+1}$ is twice as long as $r_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "`BootstrappedQueue` eliminates most suspensions by explicitly modelling the lazy evaluation of the rotation via operations on a FIFO queue. The rotation decomposes into\n",
    " - operations on the front part `f`\n",
    " - operations on  the middle queue `m = [reverse r1, ..., reverse rk]`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Representaion\n",
    "`BootstrappedQueue` has two constructors: `E` represents an empty queue while `Q` constructs a non-empty queue as a five-tuple consisting of\n",
    " 1. field `lenfm` is the combined length of the front and all the lists in the middle queue (see next fields)\n",
    " 1. next is the front part of the queue that is assumed to be non-empty\n",
    " 1. then there's the middle part which itself is a `BootstrappedQueue` but with elements being lists of elements `[a]` that represent reversals of previous rear lists\n",
    " 1. field `lenr` is the length of the rear\n",
    " 1. the last field is the rear of the queue\n",
    "\n",
    "The front and middle part (queue) represent a decomposition of the `BankersQueue`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operations\n",
    "The analysis of `reverse` and it's impact on the amortized complexity of operations is similar to the `BankersQueue` (contributes $O(1)$ amortized time).\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference is that `checkQ` may indirectly cascade reversals because it calls `snoc` on the middle queue. Fortunatly, the lists in the middle double in size and the size of the middle decreases by a logarithmic factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, `snoc` (and analogously `tail`) take $log^*(n)$ amortized time which is a constnat in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits\n",
    "> In practice, variations on these queues are the fastest known implementations for applications that use persistence sparingly, but that require good behavior even in pathological cases."
