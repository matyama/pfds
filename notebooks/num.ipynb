    "## Skew Binary Numbers\n",
    "*Skew representation* of binary numbers defines weights $w_i = 2^{i + 1} - 1$ instead of typical $2^i$ and the set of digits is $D_i = \\{\\text{0}, \\text{1}, \\text{2}\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Representation\n",
    "This representation is redundant but can be made unique (in *canonical form*) if one adds the restriction that only the lowest non-zero digit may be two.\n",
    "> Every natural number has a unique skew binary canonical form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since `inc` scans for the lowest non-zero digit (see operations below), the natural choice for representation is *sparse*. Using *dense* would require more than $O(1)$ steps which defeats the purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operations\n",
    "Observation: $1 + 2(2^{i + 1} - 1) = 2^{i + 2} - 1$. This implies\n",
    " 1. `inc` a number that doen't contain 2 => just increment the lowest digit: 0 -> 1 or 1 -> 2\n",
    " 1. `inc` a number with the lowest non-zero digit being 2 => reset it to 0 and increment the next digit\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits\n",
    " - Similarly to *lazy* and *segmented* representations, both `inc` and `dec` run in $O(1)$ worst case time in the *skew representation* (instead of $O(log(n))$)\n",
    " - The implementation is ususally simpler and faster in practice"
