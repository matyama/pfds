    "# Purely Functional Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Persistence\n",
    " - **Persistent** data structure - *always* preserves the previous version of itself when it is modified (even concurrently)\n",
    " - **Ephemeral** data structure - might not preserve its complexity characteristics when accessed and modified concurrently even when implemented as immutable (especially amortized times)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rebuilding\n",
    "**Batched rebuilding** is a balancing technique which restores a *perfect balance* for a data structure after a sequnce of updates rather than after each operation. This approach can yield the same amortized bounds as the base one given\n",
    " 1. rebuilding is not too frequent\n",
    " 1. individual updates do not significantly degrade the performance of successive ones\n",
    "\n",
    "*See formal definition in the book.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Global rebuilding** is a technique extending *batched rebuilding* which eliminates amortized bounds by executing the rebuilding transformation incrementally (few steps per operation).\n",
    "\n",
    "We maintain two copies of the data structure:\n",
    " 1. all queris and updates operate on a *primary / working copy*\n",
    " 2. while rebuilding is done on a *secondary copy*.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the rebuilding is finished these copies are swapped and updates to the previous working copy that have been buffered over time since the last swap are applied to the new one (to make it up to date).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next rebuilding might start immediately of after a while.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lazy rebuilding** is a variant of *global rebuilding* which does not immediately \"execute\" the rebuilding transformation concurrently with normal operation but rather \"pays for\" the rebuilding concurrenly. The \"execution\" is postponed to some later time when it's been \"paid for\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, with nested suspensions (created by lazy operations) it is often possible to maintain single lazy data structure in which the evaluated and memoized portion (the one that's been \"paid for\") represents the *working* part and the rest is an analogy to the *secondary copy*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to *global rebuilding* this approach is suitable for *persistent* data structures. On the other hand, it typically gives only amortized bounds (similarly to *batched rebuilding*). Fortunately, worst case bounds can usually be recovered by combining this with *scheduling* - i.e. *lazy rebuilding* with *scheduling* is an instance of *global rebuilding*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scheduling\n",
    "**Scheduling** is a technique in which a data structure maintains a collection of unevaluated suspensions (results of lazy operations) - a *schedule* - for execution at specific (controlled) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique is typically used in combination with *lazy rebuilding* to make amortized bounds worst case for persistent data structures."
