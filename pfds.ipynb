    "This `Heap` instance is based on a [Splay Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splay_tree).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits of Splay Heaps\n",
    " - Self-balancing (splaying) moves frequently accessed items closer to the root where they can be accessed more quickly in the future\n",
    " - One of the fastest heaps when persistence and `merge` are not required (with explicit minimum pointer)\n",
    " - Sorting an already sorted array with a `SplayHeap` takes just `O(n)` time\n",
    " - Balancing does not require any additional data stored in the tree (resp. nodes)"
